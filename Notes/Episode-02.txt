1. React itself not capable of making the app faster. There are lot of packages that need to be added
    which makes the app production ready, faster and scalable

2. npm manage packages but it does not stand for Node Package Manager

3. Package.json is a configuration for npm

4. There are different bundlers available. Web Pack, Parcel..etc.

5. Two types of dependencies - Dev Dependencies, Normal Dependencies

6. node modules is nothing but the code of the dependencies fetched using npm. Collection of dependencies

7. Transitive Dependencies => React app dependes => Parcel => which depends on others

8. It is important to keep package.json & package-lock.json in github. No need of node_modules because 
    we can regenerate

9. ^ => Minor changes, ~ => Major changes

10. npm => installing the packages, npx => execute a package

11. using CDN links to bring react into our app is not a recommended way insted install react as 
    package using npm

12. npx parcel index.html => Creates a server for our app

13. Parcel
    -- Dev Build
    -- Local server
    -- HMR => Hot Module Replacement => detects changes and refreshes the app
    -- File watching algorithm written in c++
    -- Caching => Faster builds
    -- Image Optimization
    -- Bundling
    -- Compressing
    -- Consistent Hashing
    -- Code Splitting
    -- Differential Bundling => to support older browsers
    -- Diagnostics
    -- Error Handling
    -- HTTPS
    -- Tree shaking => remove unused code
    -- different dev and production bundle
