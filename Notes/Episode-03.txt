We can create different type of scripts for Dev, Production ready apps.

Use package.json file => scripts section => create scripts.

Example : "startdev" : "parcel index.html",
    "startprd" : "parcel build index.html",

    now use the command => npm run {startdev/startprd}

ReactDOM.createRoot => Replaces the content

jsx => html like  or xml like syntax to create react elements easily.jsx and react are two different things. we can create react apps
without jsx also

jsx => not html inside javascript

React.createElement => React Element which is Object => renders as HTML Element

JSX => Transpiled into React.createElement by the parcel babel => gives an object which is React element =>
renders as HTML element.

Attributes in JSX syntax follow camel Case.

Two types of React Components
1. Class Based Components => Old
2. Functional Components => New

Functional Components are nothing but plain javascript function that returns JSX. Always use the captial
letter as component name in the beginning

Component Composition => Composing one component into another component

Syntax to render a Component => <ComponentName />

JSX takes care of injection data i.e. it sanitizes the data. It prevents cross site scripting attacks
